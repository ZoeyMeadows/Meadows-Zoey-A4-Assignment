Credit to Sasquatch B Studios and Brackeys for giving me a fundamental some building block of this, and my friend Iris for being my rubber ducky/ helping me fix the UNGODLY amount of bugs I experienced here. 

PS: Unity was being REALLY WEIRD with just straight up ignoring the resoultion I set it to start in, if it's showing like, a blue outline, just resize it to not do that. I've gotten it to stop doing that on mine, but I don't know if it was the settings I changed or just pure luck.

Thanks for understanding
