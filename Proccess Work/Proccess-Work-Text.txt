Idea: Simple flappy bird clone with 10 pipes.

Level will be prebuilt for efficiency.

Working menu

Pipes 

Death screen

Simple jump and gravity.

Later thoughts:

After finding a sprite sheet for flappy bird and general stuff online, I'm going to go for a more traditional endless one with a high score.
